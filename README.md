# Prompt: 

## Scenario
Suppose that we were just contacted by the Restaurant Group of San Francisco. They heard a rumor that one of their restaurants is going to sue them for unfair labor practices. In preparation, they want to understand all their employees' compensation across their restaurants.
The demo is scheduled for tomorrow - clearly not enough time to stand up a functioning, sophisticated backend.

## Task
Your task is to solve the core user problem with a web page: help our client visualize pay differences among their employees.

# Solution: 
Utilize Chart.js to create a visual representation of the data for our customers.

# Future:
Unfotunely it took me a while to figure out how to load a CSV file into my app. So that took up the majority of my time. In the future I would do a few things to make this app more user friendly.

* add buttons to allow for dinamic changes to the graph based on different demigraphics
* split the data by company so you can see where they overlap or don't
* add some colors and visual affects to make it more user friendly
* refactor my utils to be easier to read, consise, and efficent
* add utils to be able to sort by different demagraphics

# Build
I used code sandbox since I am on my personal comuputer please feel free to look go there to render it: https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/EvaFro/Pave-Frolli/tree/main/?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark
